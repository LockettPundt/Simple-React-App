## Simpler React App

The goal of this is to create a very basic, ready to go boilerplate for react projects.


To Use:

```
git clone https://github.com/LockettPundt/Simpler-React-App.git
```

```
yarn && yarn start
```

Eventuall I'd like to install it via npx and it have a similar start up as CRA.
